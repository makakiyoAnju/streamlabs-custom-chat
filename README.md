# Custom Streamlabs Chat
This uses Streamlabs' Chat Box widget with custom coding enabled. HTML, CSS, JS, and Twitch API are what are used to make it function like in the preview. <br />

*You can also change the font size within the Streamlabs Chat box widget setting without messing with the codes. You can pretty much change anything that you want within the "Custom Fields"*

**Features**
- Twitch profile pic
- Customizable functions to fit your appeal
- Changes some aspect depending on subscription & sub tier
- Functions & looks like iMessage/Android SMSing

**Preview** <br/>
